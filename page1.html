  <h1>Ashe, le kae? Ne ke batla gore...</h1>

  <p>
    Sometimes I sit quietly and think about how lucky I am to have met you — and every time, I’m filled with the same warmth, the same quiet joy, the same sense of gratitude. Even though we’ve only been together for a month, what I feel for you is already something steady, something meaningful, something that runs deeper than time alone can measure.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve been trying to find the right words to tell you how much I appreciate you, but nothing I say feels quite enough to capture it all. Still, I want to try, because you deserve to know exactly how loved you are.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the very beginning, you’ve had this calmness about you that makes my heart feel safe. You listen with intention. You speak with honesty. You love with care. There’s a softness in you that doesn’t try to take up all the space — instead, it makes room for me. For my thoughts, my emotions, my quirks, and even my insecurities. You let me show up fully as myself, and that is such a rare, beautiful gift.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every conversation with you feels like a little home — a place where I can exhale, where I’m not trying to impress or explain too much. You just get me in a way that’s hard to put into words. And that connection? That comfort? It’s not something I take for granted. You bring peace to my world, Mathemba, and I hope you know that.
