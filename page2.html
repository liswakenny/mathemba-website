    You make me feel seen — not just noticed, but really seen. You notice the little things about me and remember them. You make space for my silence and still laugh at my weird jokes. You’re thoughtful without needing a reason, kind without needing recognition, and you carry this gentle strength that I admire more and more each day.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a world where everything can feel so fast and uncertain, you’ve been a beautiful reminder that some things can still be soft, and true, and worth holding onto. Being with you has brought so much light into my life — the kind that stays, even when things are quiet or hard. And although we’re still getting to know each other, there’s a part of me that already feels like it’s known you forever. Like our hearts have whispered to each other before we ever exchanged a single word.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can’t help but imagine what the next months, years, and seasons of life might look like with you by my side. I imagine more laughter, more deep conversations, more quiet moments filled with nothing but the comfort of just being close. I imagine celebrating each other’s wins, holding space for each other’s bad days, and choosing each other again and again — not just in words, but in effort, in action, in love.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are, without question, one of the best things to ever happen to me.
