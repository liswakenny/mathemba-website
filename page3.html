    It’s wild how much someone can come to mean to you in just a few weeks — but here I am, writing pages of words, and still feeling like none of it is quite enough to explain how much I appreciate you.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are gentle strength. You are kindness in human form. You are peace in a noisy world. I look at you and I see someone I can grow with, someone I can build with, someone I can be completely myself with. That kind of connection is rare, and I don’t take it for granted — not even for a second.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think about our future sometimes — not in a pressured or rushed way — but in a soft, hopeful way. I think about all the things I still want to learn about you. I want to know your dreams, your fears, your childhood stories, your favorite songs, the things that make you feel most alive. I want to walk beside you through all the ups and downs, cheering you on, holding your hand, and being a safe space for your heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even now, in these early days, I feel like we’re building something real — something worth nurturing, something full of potential and light.
