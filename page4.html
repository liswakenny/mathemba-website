    I want you to know that I’m here. For all the good days and the quiet ones too. I want to be someone you can lean on, someone you can trust, someone who brings you peace and warmth, the way you do for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    You’ve already given me so much — more than you probably realize. I feel more confident, more open, more hopeful since meeting you. You’ve inspired me just by being who you are. And I love that I can say these things to you and not feel shy or afraid — because you’ve made this space between us feel safe, feel real, feel sacred.
  </p>
  <p>
    No matter what the future holds, I’m thankful for this chapter. I’m thankful for every conversation, every smile, every sweet moment we’ve shared. I’m thankful that you chose me — and I promise you, I won’t ever take your love for granted.
  </p>
  <p>
    You matter to me, Mathemba. Deeply. More than you know. And I will continue to show up for you — with love, with patience, with intention, with care.
