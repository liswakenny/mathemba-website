    So here it is — five pages later — and still, my heart feels like it’s overflowing with things I want to say to you. You’ve already given me so much in just a short amount of time — comfort, joy, peace, hope. You’ve become a light in my life that I didn’t know I needed until you were here.
  </p>
  <p>
    Loving you feels gentle and natural. It doesn’t feel rushed or forced. It feels like deep breaths, like calm after the storm. You’ve brought such steadiness into my life, just by being yourself. I don’t feel like I have to perform or be anything other than who I am around you — and that feeling of acceptance is so incredibly rare. You’ve shown me that being loved doesn’t have to feel complicated — that love can be soft, patient, and real.
  </p>
  <p>
    And even though we’re still at the beginning of our story, I feel proud of us. Proud of the way we talk to each other, proud of the way we show up, proud of the trust we’re slowly building with care. It feels meaningful. It feels worth every moment. And I want to keep nurturing it with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    More than anything, I want you to know that I’m not here for the temporary. I’m not here just to enjoy the good days. I want the deep stuff, the messy stuff, the honest stuff. I want to be there when you’re at your best and when you’re unsure. I want to cheer you on, lift you up, and remind you — always — that you are loved, valued, and never alone.
  </p>
