    As I write this last page, I feel overwhelmed in the best possible way — overwhelmed by the sweetness of what we’re building, and by the quiet, steady affection I already feel for you. And I want to end this letter not just with more love, but with some wishes for you, from my heart to yours.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wish for you to always feel peace — even on the hard days.<br>
    I wish for you to always feel safe — in your mind, your heart, and especially with me.<br>
    I wish for you to always chase your dreams, knowing I’ll be here, believing in you fully.<br>
    I wish for you to never doubt how much you matter — to the world, and especially to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to be someone who adds to your life — who supports you, understands you, and loves you in all the ways you need. I want to create a space with you that feels like home, no matter where we are. A love that’s not perfect, but honest. One we can keep choosing, over and over again.
  </p>
  <p>
    So thank you, again and again, for being a beautiful soul. For showing me something rare. For reminding me that even in a short amount of time, true connection can blossom — and it can be soft, strong, and so full of light.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here’s to many more days of us. Many more pages in this story.<br>
    I adore you, Mathemba — with more love than these words can hold.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forever yours,
    Your wife
